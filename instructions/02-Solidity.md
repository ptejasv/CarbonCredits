# 02. Solidity and Remix

MetaMask is sufficient to use ETH as a cryptocurrency - you can send and receive ETH. But to develop smart contracts and Dapps, you need more than that. 


### Solidity
We will use the programming language Solidity. You are asked to acquire the required knowledge of it on your own, and many free resources for this are available online. 
  - Solidity descriptions: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/. 
  - Look under “Solidity by Example” for some examples that will allow you to get started quickly with your project. 

### Remix
To write and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain we will use Remix. 
(You can in principle use other tools, but we will not be able to support you if you do. )
  - Remix official: https://remix-project.org/
  - Remix docs: https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  - Remix online IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/
  - Deploying and interacting with a smart contract is slightly nontrivial. You can however essentially follow the instructions here: https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/create_deploy.html
  - **Important**: Make sure that MetaMask is running in your Browser and choose "Injected Web3" as your environment for deployment. The website will then use MetaMask and your address on Sepolia to generate the necessary blockchain transactions. 
  - **Important**: <span style = "color:#EE2222">In case you also have Ethereum on the main net, make sure that MetaMask is using your Sepolia address. Deploying contracts on the main net can be expensive.<span>

  - You can then use [Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) to visit both your contract and your own address and see all the transactions that have taken place.
